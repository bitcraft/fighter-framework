some significant changes to the engine and some bug fixes.
added some comments in the code, in case you are interested.  i usually
work on this once or twice a month, so i need to keep it documented
for myself!

new stuff:

* state driver is more consistent, so game will not crash after 3 rounds
* hit boxes can be read as overlays on each frame: no hardcoding hitboxes!
* framerate locked at 40fps
* timing is more accurate and consistent
* sounds are more accurate
* moved all the game py files to a library folder
* tweaked ai and split blocking and attacking

unfortunately, a couple bugs were introduced!
a new bug is that some frames on the 2nd player are still red, when
they should be white.  not sure how it got messed up!

projectiles will not be added, that was a joke.

using a new class callback timer more often.  simplifies many timed
events, but also makes it harder to control the order they are executed.
in the future, the world could have a list dedicated to updating timers.
when a timer is added to the que, it will be added last, so that updates
are happen in a logical order (enforce this).

ai, fighter, and autoblacker class all share a lot of code...working to 
unify them.  =)

fixed some ai problems.
refactored the avatar class to limit memory usage.
added some options to cache sprites.
added a game state system, so control flow of game better
added a menu (not in use)
fixed hit confirms
new rendering system
added experimental "zoom" rendering system
various issus with objects not beeing garbage collected
	- on this point, wek refs would be nice if i could figure how to
	use them properly.  =)

because i'm using [potentially] copyrighted images, i've started a new
	fighter based on actual footage of a fighter.  high framerate so
	it looks smooth, and could potentially slow action for dramatic
	effect!

fixed some issues with keys not being registered

ideas:
	turn based...start 2 seconds per turn, decide the move
	as round continues, input time decreases
	"a good fight is like a game of chess"
		every move should have a clear counter part/block or evade like RPS


	v cpu.  like a fight sequence in a kung fu movie:
		same pattern every time.  master it thru repitition
	end of fight should be played back at full speed, for dramatic effect
	taunts?

	music or drums to keep rhythm


	memory usage:
	frames can be cached if the rects are managed by the avatar.
	currently, the avatar just gets that information from the frame

ton of changes!
smarter collision handling
block/whiff confirms (they look blue)
ai works great!
auto block for human players (66% chance to block)
matches have rounds (3 by default)
players fall when hit
cleared some memory issues
3 modes:
	player vs cpu    (press f1)
	player vs player (press f2)
	cpu vs cpu       (press f3)

ai:
difficulty is 0 - 100
ai can evade attacks
ai doesn't have fsa, so does crazy cancels (a bug)

removed flips.  cpu is too cheap with them.

go ahead and try it!  playable!


6/23/10
cleaned up input some.  move should "feel" more responsive.
cpu fighter will now block every move.
---a hit confirm is still shown, just for kicks
hit boxes are more generic and properly linked to parents


6/22/10
autoblocking, almost
misc. fixes with looping frames


6/20/10
for pygame website
There really is no name for this thing.  I would have used "pyfighter", but it
was already taken.  =)

Currently, only the controls are implemented.  No health bars, rounds, menus,
etc.  Want to do that?  =)

I want this incarnation to play something like the orginal "International
Karate", but with a few modern embellishments, like combos, blocking, and
more than two players and/or more cpu players.

What works:
Attack Holds (see below)
Fluid controls with combos
Cancels (smooth transition between animations)
Player movement left, right, jumping, crouching
Hit detection, with glitz
Loading characters/fighters
Sounds on hits and misses (ripped from enter the dragon, like IK)
Recording input for playback later

Obvious bugs:
Walking animations are really ugly
Missing a turn animation
Walking past the other player causes a glitch in movement.
Hitboxes need tweaking
"Hit Confirms" do not appear where a hit occurs
Hitting different kicks at once sometimes cancels out of crouch
Animations are slower than input.  You don't see every hit.
pygame event handling eats ton of cpu

physics don't really have a place in this engine.  sprite movement and "physics"
are handled by the animation, not the engine.  this is deliberate, b/c i want
total control over how the sprites move and react.

proposed system:

move the get keys to a loop that gets called on a set freq,
maybe 15hz, which is twice of the update freq for avatars

atacking fighters should have sprites moved forward to front


== B U G S =====================================================================
b/c avatar updates are scheduled as part of animation frames,
there is no way of canceling a move quickly if the frame as a long ttl

possible speed improvement is "behind the scenes", conversion of animation
names to base 2 numbers, giving way to masking like in buttons.  would allow
for groups/wildcards in a non-cpu intensive manner.
ok for now/not important

cannot cancel combos into combos.
easy fix: check end of move history instead of the hash lookup

animation defs do not need to be listed one-after-another...can be "sparse"...
but, internally, the numbers don't mean anything, so yeah.

================================================================================
dont forget:
	images loaded in animations are expected to be in the animation folder
	sounds loaded in animations are expected to be the the sounds folder
